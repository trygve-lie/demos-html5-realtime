        <h1>"HTML5" Clients Interacting Demos</h1>
        <p>
            These are small demos using two or more clients interacting with each other in real time. Most demos has a recorder
            and a screen. The recorder are used as a "remote control" to control whats going on on the remote "screen".
            These demos does show some new and experimental parts in browsers using native implementations so each demo might
            require different browser versions / experimental browser builds.
        </p>
        <p>
            When using a demo with both a recorder and a screen, open the recorder in the client (device) which shall be
            the controlling part and the screen in the client which shall be the controlled part.
